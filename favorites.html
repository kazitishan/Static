            I have watched and played soccer since I was young. I used to play with my neighborhood 
            friends all day. My favorite team is Chelsea, and I started supporting them because Oscar and 
            Eden Hazard were my favorite players. My first vivid memory of watching soccer was during the 
            2014 World Cup, where I was rooting for Brazil. I play soccer with my friends in the Brooklyn 
            Tech Soccer Club every Friday at Pier 5, Pier 2, or Parade Grounds. Also, Messi is the GOAT.

            I love listening to music while working and while I am outside. Music helps me disconnect from 
            the world and enter my own realm. My favorite genre is hip-hop, and my favorite artists are 
            Playboi Carti, A$AP Rocky, Tyler The Creator, Westside Gunn, Yung Lean, and many more. I went to 
            a Don Toliver concert this summer with my sister, and it was so much fun!
